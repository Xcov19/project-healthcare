## Setting Up Your Development Environment
### - Install Dependencies:

#### Set Up the Development Environment

Run this command to use Poetry for installing all necessary tools and libraries in your virtual environment, ensuring everything works correctly with pre-commit:

`make install` 

#### Install Code Quality Tools

Use this command to set up automatic checks that will help catch errors in your code before you commit it:

`pre-commit install`
 
### - Configure Your Editor (Optional):

Set up your preferred code editor or IDE for a smooth development experience. Consider installing extensions or plugins for syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging specific to the programming languages used in the project.

## Reporting Bugs Or Issues üêû

Before reporting a bug, please determine the type of issue you're encountering:

- Security or Vulnerability Issue: If your bug involves a security vulnerability, such as a potential breach or unauthorized access, please follow our [Security Template](https://github.com/Xcov19/project-healthcare/security/advisories/new).

- Non-Security Related Bug: For all other types of bugs, please use the [C4GT Community Template](https://github.com/Xcov19/project-healthcare/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=c4gt_community.yml&title=%5BC4GT+Community%5D%3A+).

Your accurate classification helps us address issues more efficiently.

### 1. Search Existing Issues  üîç:

Go through the [open issues](https://github.com/Xcov19/project-healthcare/issues) to see if the issue has already been reported.

### 2. If the Issue Isn't Reportedüìù:

Open a new issue on GitHub by following the most appropriate template as mentioned above. Provide clear and concise details to help the team understand and reproduce the bug.

#### Helpful Bug Report Template

Consider following this format for clarity:
-  Summary: Brief description of the issue.
-  Steps to Reproduce: Clear steps to replicate the issue.
-  Expected Behavior: What you expected to happen.
-  Actual Behavior: What actually happened, including relevant error messages.
-  Code/Configuration: Share code snippets or configuration files.
-  Screenshots/Images: If applicable, include screenshots.

### 3. If you get stuck while working on an Issue

If you encounter a bug or get stuck while working on an issue, please follow these steps to ensure your findings are shared in a way that helps others understand and reproduce the problem:

#### 1. Include Clear Steps to Reproduce
- Provide a step-by-step guide on how the issue can be reproduced.
- Include the environment setup (e.g., OS, Programming language/Python version, dependencies) where the bug occurs.

#### 2. Share the Error Output and Code Separately
- If there‚Äôs a traceback or error message, paste it in text format with relevant markdown formatting. Avoid sharing only screenshots of the error.
- Provide the relevant code snippet that causes the issue. If it‚Äôs a test, share the entire test case that reproduces the bug.
- Example format:
```bash

Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    raise NotImplementedError(f"""Signature for {defined_method} not correct:
NotImplementedError: Signature for method_with_params not correct:
                Expected: ['self', 'param1', 'param2']
                Got: ['self', 'param1']
```

#### 3. Screenshots as Supplementary Evidence
Use screenshots as supplementary information to showcase any visual issues or UI-specific bugs. However, ensure the primary details like code, errors, and steps are shared as text.

#### 4. Link to Issue or Pull Request
Whenever possible, link your findings to the relevant GitHub issue or pull request to keep the context consistent.

#### 5. Follow the Issue Description
Double-check the issue description and goals before posting to ensure your submission aligns with the intended scope. If the issue states a specific requirement, verify that your shared code and bug details address this point.


## Submitting a Patch

#### 1. Create a Branchüåø:

Create a new branch for your bug fix or new feature. Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the change you're making. Here's an example command:

`
git checkout -b new-branch-name`

#### 2. Make Your Changes and Commit Them:

Edit the code to address the bug or implement the new feature.

**Testing Your Changes üß™** 

To ensure your changes align with our guidelines, please follow these steps to test them:

Testing Framework: We use pytest as our test runner. This helps us ensure that the codebase remains reliable and any new changes are correctly implemented. 

Locate Test Files: You can find the test files in the [tests directory](./xcov19/tests).

Run Tests: Set up a virtual environment and run the following command. This will install all required dependencies, including those needed for testing.

`
make install
`

Navigate to the [tests directory](./xcov19/tests) and run the tests with the command 

`
pytest
`

Pytest will automatically discover and execute all the test files and functions.
View Results: After running the tests, review the output to ensure all tests pass. If there are any issues, please address them before submitting your pull request.

**Stage and commit your changes using Git‚úÖ:** 

`git add path/to/specific/file`

`git commit -m "Descriptive message about changes in that file"`

(Use descriptive commit messages that start with an action verb and clearly explain what you changed.)

#### 3. Push Your Branchüõ†Ô∏è:

Once all tests pass without any issues push your branch to the remote repository on GitHub, referencing the issue it addresses. Use the following command:

`
git push origin branch-name`

Additionally, include a note in your pull request (PR) indicating whether it will fix, close, or address the linked issue. Every PR should be associated with at least one issue.

#### 4. Open a Pull Request (PR)üì¶:

On GitHub, navigate to your repository and go to the "Pull requests" tab.

Click on "New pull request" and select your branch to create a PR.

Provide a clear and concise title and description for your PR.

Briefly explain the changes you made and address any related issues in the description.

### Proposing New Featuresüõ†Ô∏è

### 1. Open an Issueüìù:

To propose new features, please use the [C4GT Community Template](https://github.com/Xcov19/project-healthcare/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=c4gt_community.yml&title=%5BC4GT+Community%5D%3A+). This template helps ensure that all necessary details are included and makes it easier for us to review and prioritize your suggestions.

### 2. Get Feedback and Collaborateüí¨:
